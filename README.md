# Estimating ground state energy with classical shadows
This notebook implements the ideas of [1] and attempts to reconstruct the experimental results therein.

# Status
This notebook is now complete and undergoing testing. 

# How to use
Requires the package predicting-quantum-properties from https://github.com/hsinyuan-huang/predicting-quantum-properties

There are three files:
1. [Electronic_structure_problem_vqe_randomized_classical_shadow.ipynb](https://github.com/renatawong/classical-shadow-vqe/blob/0c931801968c97d76ba769f921bdd6f396697823/Electronic_structure_problem_vqe_randomized_classical_shadow.ipynb) : VQE using vanilla classical shadow.
2. [Electronic_structure_problem_vqe_derandomized_classical_shadow.ipynb](https://github.com/renatawong/classical-shadow-vqe/blob/0c931801968c97d76ba769f921bdd6f396697823/Electronic_structure_problem_vqe_derandomized_classical_shadow.ipynb) : VQE using classical shadow with derandomized Hamiltonian.
3. [Electronic_structure_problem_vqe_derand_classical_shadow_optimized.ipynb](https://github.com/renatawong/classical-shadow-vqe/blob/e1fe074caf84d559fa279fb909f3c070ca9fe1be/Electronic_structure_problem_vqe_derand_classical_shadow_optimized.ipynb) : As above but with time optimization. The calculation takes significantly less time than the non-optimised version (2).
