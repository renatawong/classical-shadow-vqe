# Electronic structure problem (estimating ground state energy) with VQE and classical shadows
The notebooks implement the idea in [1] (see the experiments therein) and extend the application of classical shadows to each iteration of VQE.

# Status
The notebooks are complete. 

# How to use the notebooks
Requires the package predicting-quantum-properties from [2].

There are a total of six files that calculate the electronic structure problem:
1. [electronic_structure_problem_dcs.ipynb](https://github.com/renatawong/classical-shadow-vqe/blob/c2403b4b3940f6846cfceeae7e2d1f6102d3b0a9/electronic_structure_problem_dcs.ipynb) : Electronic structure problem with shadow (derandomized) applied on the optimal set of angles only. This is the original idea in [1].
2. [electronic_structure_problem_rcs.ipynb](https://github.com/renatawong/classical-shadow-vqe/blob/e3f261bda8ffd35f4781cc3822fe094e64fc2e88/electronic_structure_problem_rcs.ipynb) : Electronic structure problem with shadow (randomized) applied on the optimal set of angles only.

The below files on the other hand apply classical shadow in each cost function evaluation of VQE:

1. [vqe_rcs_qiskit.ipynb](https://github.com/renatawong/classical-shadow-vqe/blob/8e5f0060ceb3f4036c2b4508e1d02d168edae2f5/vqe_rcs_qiskit.ipynb) : Electronic structure problem using VQE with the vanilla classical shadow (i.e. randomised basis change).
2. [vqe_rcs_qiskit_optimized.ipynb](https://github.com/renatawong/classical-shadow-vqe/blob/16f33d1e10e0a91bdf09008d1daa390b7f95fd6a/vqe_rcs_qiskit_optimized.ipynb): As above but with optimization. 
3. [vqe_dcs_qiskit.ipynb](https://github.com/renatawong/classical-shadow-vqe/blob/403e615a20d58d6313b0bc858a3719b1793892a2/vqe_dcs_qiskit.ipynb) : Electronic structure problem using VQE with ``derandomised'' classical shadow (i.e. derandomised Hamiltonian used for basis change).
4. [vqe_dcs_qiskit_optimized.ipynb](https://github.com/renatawong/classical-shadow-vqe/blob/382d30f9ac8d1d8e2d1d6365aa4747cd57b2efae/vqe_dcs_qiskit_optimized.ipynb) : As above but with time optimization. 

Calculations using the optimized versions take significantly less time than with the non-optimised versions.

File [modified_derandomization.py](https://github.com/renatawong/classical-shadow-vqe/blob/6d5051170bc193637e8f8251ce8d80f027d3ea14/modified_derandomization.py) contains a modified version of the file 'data_acquisition_shadow.py' in the package 'predicting-quantum-properties' [2]. This modification allows the user to specify the number of derandomised operators to be generated. In the original version [2], the user had to specify the number of evaluations per observable, which did not allow for control over the total number of generated operators. 

The folder [experimental-results](https://github.com/renatawong/classical-shadow-vqe/tree/72ff46c435a449eeee5d2f38a93a7c19700495c5/experimental-results) contains the experimental results for the molecules $H_2$, $LiH$, $BeH_2$, $H_2O$, and $NH_3$. Note that [1] doesn't specify how to obtain a required number of derandomized operators, instead it one must pass a number of evaluations per observable. This results in the number of required operators being either unergenerated or overgenerated. Hence, in order to be able to verify the results of [1], we do a postprocessing on the method for generating derandomized operators from [2]. Essentially, we pass the parameter '50' to 'derandomized_classical_shadow.py' as the number of evaluations per observable, and then we either add operators to the output or decrease the number of operators in the output, depending on how many operators are needed for each test. Our method works for the tested molecules, but no guarantee is given for the general case.
