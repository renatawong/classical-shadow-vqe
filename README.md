# Estimating ground state energy with classical shadows
This notebook implements the ideas of [1] and attempts to reconstruct the experimental results therein.

# Status
This notebook is now complete and undergoing testing. 

# How to use
Requires the package predicting-quantum-properties from https://github.com/hsinyuan-huang/predicting-quantum-properties

# Acknowledgements
This notebook is based on the theory described in [1].

The code was written by Renata Wong.

This work benefited greatly from discussions with Prof. Hsi-Sheng Goan (National Taiwan University), Prof. Hao-Chung Cheng (National Taiwan University), Prof. Jyh-Pin Chou (National Changhua University of Education), and Hsin Yuan (Robert) Huang (California Institute of Technology). All remaining deficiencies are my own.
